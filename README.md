# Assignment 3 303 
## Synopsis 
This program defines and alters both a queue of numbers and a vector. 
It has the ability to 
- Use push, pop, front, size, and empty functions on the queue
- Move a value from the front to the rear of the queue  
- Find the index of the last time a value occurs in a vector.
- Sort the queue using an insertion sort function. 



##Files
The program has two main files;
-303_Assignment_3.cpp: This file is the main file that is used. It has all of the functions and the main line of code 
-Queue.h: This file outlines all of the functions that are used in the program and clearly defines them with comments. 


## Functions 
Void Push: Adds the element to the queue

Void Pop: Removes the next element from the queue

T front: Finds the front of the queue

int size: Finds the size of the queue

Bool empty: Determines if the queue is empty

Void Move_to_rear: Moves the front element in the queue to the end of the queue

Void insertion_sort_queue: Sorts the queue using insertion sort

Void insertion_sort: Helper function to sort the queue

Void Display_vector: Displays the contents of the vector

Int linear_search: Searches for the final occurance of a number in a vector  


- This program requires no user input to run 
- The contents of the queue and vector are filled automatically
- The user needs to get the files and compile and then the functions listed above will occur
